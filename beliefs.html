			<section>
				<article class="a1">
					<p>Miyazaki’s creativity stemmed from his childhood, inspiring him to enter the film industry. Born in the suburbs of Tokyo in the mid-war year of 1941, Miyazaki grew up under the influence of his father, who “helped run a family-owned factory that made parts for military airplanes,” and his mother who was strong-willed but often bedridden (Talbot, 2005). Against the backdrop of war, Miyazaki found comfort in fantasy books.</p>
				</article>

				<article class="a2">
					<p>In fact, Miyazaki’s childhood experiences are often incorporated into his fantasy films, like the theme of aeronautics in <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, lost childhood in <em>Spirited Away</em>, and pacifism in <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> (Mishan 2021). Miyazaki’s childhood in the wartime gave birth not only to his fantasy films, but also his first lesson on the complexity of human beings, a lifelong interest explored in all of his works.</p>

				<article class="a1">
					<p>Miyazaki’s imaginations come from the Japanese religion, Shintō, where “absolute principles of right and wrong have no place in” (Barkman, 2019). This belief is seen in <em>Spirited Away</em>, where the seemingly villainous creature, No-Face, who swallows people everywhere he goes, turns out to have good nature and lets go out his victims eventually.</p>
				</article>

				<article class="a2">
					<p>Shintōism also argues that everyone should view the most original world through the untainted eyes of children. In <em>Spirited Away</em>, young Chihiro notices the dangerous atmosphere in the valley while the adults are occupied by its luxuries. Indeed, Miyazaki uses Shintōistic ideas to motivate the audience to never dictate the right or wrong and to see the world from a newborn perspective, free of prejudice.</p>
