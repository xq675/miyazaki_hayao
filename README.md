# Miyazaki Hayao: The Living Legend of Anime

This is a multi-page academic website that explores the life, beliefs, and cinematic themes of animator Miyazaki Hayao. The site is divided into three key areas: The World of Miyazaki Hayao, Beliefs Behind the Scenes, and A Mix of Real and Fantasy. The design uses semantic articles and sections to present cited research and includes an interactive quiz element on each page to engage users with the material.
