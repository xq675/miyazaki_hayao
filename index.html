				<article class="a1">
					<p>Watching Miyazaki Hayao’s <em>Spirited Away</em> at age 10, I was attracted to its colorful illustrations of the bathhouse. Watching it again several years later, its deeper message of fearing the unknown and realistic characterization of Chihiro pulled me in again. In Japan, his films are as popular as Disney movies are in America. Globally, even Pixar’s director, John Lasseter, once called him “the world’s greatest living animator.”</p>

				<article class="a2">
					<p>Miyazaki began his animation career in 1963 with Toei Animation, a Japanese cartoon company, and founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, which is now one of the most iconic names in film. Miyazaki’s Oscar-winning <em>Spirited Away</em> (2002), made “global demand for anime [reach] a fever pitch” (Bigelow, 2009).</p>

					<p>Japanese animation, also known as “anime,” roots itself in its comic-book form, “manga,” which reaches audiences of all ages, building the foundation for the global proliferation of anime. On top of that, Miyazaki’s movies stand out among the rest due to his ability to bridge cultural gaps. His movies blur the boundaries between cultures by incorporating Western components, as seen in Miyazaki’s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, “a fantasy set in a future world suggestive of medieval Europe” (Lu, 2008). By appealing to audiences of all ages around the globe, Miyazaki’s creativity in making films globalized the concept of anime.</p>
